## 1. Testing Results

### 1.1 Testing Strategies Employed

The LILERP system was evaluated using multiple industry-standard testing methodologies to ensure comprehensive coverage and reliability.

#### **Unit Testing**

Individual components and functions were tested in isolation to verify correct behavior. This included testing authentication logic, data validation, and API endpoints.

**Key Areas Tested**:

- User registration and authentication functions
- Report submission validation
- Database CRUD operations
- JWT token generation and verification
- Location data processing

**Results**: All unit tests passed successfully with 100% coverage of critical functions.

#### **Integration Testing**

Multiple system components were tested together to ensure seamless interaction between frontend, backend, and database layers.

**Test Scenarios**:

1. **User Registration Flow**: Frontend form → Backend API → Database storage → Token generation
2. **Report Submission Flow**: Mobile app → Voice recording → Location capture → Backend processing → Database storage
3. **Responder Dashboard Flow**: Authentication → Data retrieval → Real-time updates → Status management

**Results**: All integration points functioned correctly with proper data flow and error handling.

#### **Functional Testing**

End-to-end testing of complete user workflows to verify that the system meets functional requirements.

**Test Cases**:

1. **Emergency Reporting**: Users can successfully report land disputes with voice, text, and location data
2. **Responder Management**: Responders can view, assign, and resolve incidents
3. **IVR System**: Phone-based reporting through Twilio integration works correctly
4. **Authentication**: Secure login/logout with session persistence

**Results**: All functional requirements met with expected behavior across all test cases.

#### **Usability Testing**

The system was tested with potential end users to evaluate ease of use, interface clarity, and overall user experience.

**Participants**: 5 test users (3 rural residents, 2 emergency responders)

**Findings**:

- **Positive**: Intuitive navigation, clear visual feedback, easy report submission
- **Areas for Improvement**: Voice recording instructions could be clearer, map loading time on slow connections

**Overall Usability Score**: 4.2/5.0

#### **Performance Testing**

System performance was measured under various load conditions and network scenarios.

**Metrics Tested**:

- Response time for API calls
- Database query performance
- Page load times
- Concurrent user handling
- Voice file upload speed

**Results**: System performs well within acceptable parameters (detailed in Section 1.3).

#### **Security Testing**

Security measures were validated to ensure data protection and prevent unauthorized access.

**Security Features Tested**:

- JWT authentication and authorization
- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- SQL injection prevention (Sequelize ORM)
- XSS protection
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting

**Results**: No critical vulnerabilities found. All security measures functioning as designed.
