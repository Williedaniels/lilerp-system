## üé§ Presentation Script

### Opening (2 minutes)
> "Good morning. I'm Willie Daniels, and I'm excited to present LILERP - the Liberia Integrated Land Registry and Emergency Response Platform. This system addresses a critical gap in rural Liberia: emergency response for land disputes."

### Problem Statement (3 minutes)
> "In rural Liberia, land disputes are a major source of conflict. The 2003-2018 civil war was partly fueled by land issues. Today, 64% of rural Liberians lack access to emergency services. Existing solutions like My Watchman cost $20-50 per month - unaffordable for rural communities earning $1-2 per day."

### Solution Overview (5 minutes)
> "LILERP provides a voice-first emergency response system specifically designed for illiterate users. It integrates traditional governance structures with modern technology, respecting cultural protocols while providing 24/7 emergency access."

### Live Demo (10 minutes)
1. **IVR Call Simulation** (3 minutes)
2. **Mobile App Walkthrough** (4 minutes)
3. **Backend Dashboard** (3 minutes)

### Impact & Future (3 minutes)
> "LILERP can reduce emergency response time from hours to minutes, extend coverage to rural areas, and prevent land disputes from escalating to violence. Future phases include blockchain integration, AI-powered analytics, and nationwide deployment."

### Q&A (7 minutes)
Common questions and prepared answers below.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Technical Questions

**Q: How does the system work without internet?**
A: The IVR system works on basic phone networks (2G/3G). The mobile app has offline capability and syncs when connectivity is available. SMS backup ensures notifications reach responders even in low-connectivity areas.

**Q: What about language barriers?**
A: Phase 1 supports English with simple voice prompts. Phase 2 will add Mano, Gio, and Kpelle languages. The system uses pictograms and audio cues to minimize literacy requirements.

**Q: How do you ensure data security?**
A: We implement end-to-end encryption, anonymous reporting options, role-based access control, and GDPR compliance. All data is stored securely with audit trails for accountability.

### Cultural Questions

**Q: How do you respect traditional governance?**
A: Traditional chiefs are primary responders in the system. We don't replace traditional structures - we enhance them with modern communication tools. All protocols respect customary law and cultural practices.

**Q: What if chiefs don't want to use technology?**
A: Chiefs receive simple SMS notifications and can respond via voice calls. No smartphone or technical skills required. The system adapts to their preferred communication methods.

### Implementation Questions

**Q: How much does it cost to implement?**
A: The capstone prototype costs $470. Full implementation would require $50,000-100,000 for infrastructure, training, and deployment across Nimba County. This is significantly less than building traditional emergency infrastructure.

**Q: How do you ensure sustainability?**
A: We're exploring partnerships with the Liberia Land Authority, international NGOs, and telecom providers. Revenue models include government contracts, donor funding, and minimal user fees for premium features.

**Q: What about scalability?**
A: The system is designed for cloud deployment and can scale to handle thousands of concurrent users. The architecture supports nationwide expansion with minimal additional infrastructure.
