## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Fixed ✅

**Problem**: SQLite database had permission issues and model definition errors

**Fixes Applied**:

- Tested registration and report submission

**Result**: Database now works perfectly!

**Test Results**:
```bash
✅ User Registration: Working
✅ User Login: Working  
✅ Report Submission: Working
✅ Data Persistence: Working
```

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/server.js` (lines 63-87, 179-182, 1244)

### 2. Report Forms Fixed ✅

**Problem**: Report submission needed testing

**Fixes Applied**:
- Verified all API endpoints are working
- Tested report submission with real data
- Confirmed data is saved to database

**Test Results**:
```bash
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/incidents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [token]" \
  -d '{"type":"boundary_dispute","description":"Test report",...}'

Response: {"message":"Incident reported successfully",...}
✅ SUCCESS
```

**Result**: Report forms submit smoothly!

### 3. Responder Dashboard Link ✅

**Status**: Already implemented in your design!

**Location**: Profile screen (lines 1470-1480 in App.jsx)

**Your Implementation**:
```jsx
{user?.isResponder && (
  <Button
    onClick={handleNavigateToResponderDashboard}
    variant="outline"
    className="w-full"
  >
    <Shield className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
    Go to Responder Dashboard
    <ExternalLink className="w-4 h-4 ml-2" />
  </Button>
)}
```

**Features**:
- Only shows if user is a responder
- Beautiful button with Shield icon
