## üìù Detailed Script

### Opening (30 seconds)

**[Screen: System Architecture Diagram]**

"This is LILERP - a voice-based emergency response system for rural Liberia. The system addresses land disputes through three integrated components: a Node.js backend with PostgreSQL database, a React website, and a mobile Progressive Web App, all connected through Twilio's IVR system for voice-based emergency reporting."

### Backend API Demonstration (2 minutes)

**[Screen: Terminal/Postman]**

"Let me start by demonstrating the backend API functionality."

**[Show server startup]**
```bash
cd backend && npm start
```

"The server starts on port 3001 with PostgreSQL database connection."

**[Switch to Postman]**

"First, I'll register a new user through our authentication system."

**[POST /api/auth/register]**
```json
{
  "username": "demo_responder",
  "password": "password123",
  "role": "responder"
}
```

"The system returns a JWT token for authenticated requests."

**[Show login endpoint]**
```json
{
  "username": "demo_responder",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

"Now I'll create an incident report using the authenticated token."

**[POST /api/incidents with Bearer token]**
```json
{
  "caller_number": "+231123456789",
  "location": "Ganta Village, Nimba County",
  "incident_type": "Land Boundary Dispute",
  "description": "Neighbor dispute over ancestral land boundaries"
}
```

"The incident is created with a unique ID and stored in PostgreSQL with proper relationships."

**[GET /api/incidents to show retrieval]**

"I can retrieve all incidents with full details including reporter information and timestamps."

---

### Database Schema Demonstration (45 seconds)

**[Screen: Database client or pgAdmin]**

"The database schema includes three main tables with proper relationships."

**[Show Users table]**
"Users table stores authentication and role information."

**[Show Incidents table]**
"Incidents table contains emergency reports with foreign key to the reporter."

**[Show Responses table]**
"Responses table tracks responder actions linked to specific incidents."

**[Show a JOIN query]**
"The relationships allow complex queries joining incident data with user information."

---

### Website Demonstration (1.5 minutes)

**[Screen: Browser at localhost:5173]**

"The React-based website provides a professional interface for the emergency response system."

**[Navigate through homepage]**

"The landing page explains the system's purpose and impact. Notice the responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices."

**[Scroll through features section]**

"The features section highlights the voice-first approach and cultural integration with traditional governance structures."

**[Show statistics dashboard]**

"This statistics section would display real-time data about incidents and response times in a production deployment."

**[Demonstrate contact form]**

"The contact form allows NGOs and government agencies to inquire about partnerships."

**[Show mobile responsiveness]**

"The entire site is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes for mobile users."

---

### Mobile App Demonstration (1.5 minutes)

**[Screen: Browser at localhost:5174]**

"The mobile Progressive Web App provides emergency reporting capabilities for smartphone users."

**[Show emergency reporting form]**

"Users can report emergencies through this simple form interface."

**[Demonstrate form fields]**

"The form captures location, incident type, and description with clear validation."

**[Show voice recording simulation]**

"In a production environment, this would capture actual voice recordings using the device's microphone."

**[Show GPS location feature]**

"The app would integrate with device GPS to automatically capture precise location coordinates."

**[Navigate to report tracking]**

"Users can track their submitted reports and see status updates from responders."

**[Show direct calling interface]**

"Emergency calling features provide direct access to traditional chiefs and emergency services."

---

### IVR System Integration (1.5 minutes)

**[Screen: Code editor showing IVR routes]**

"The IVR system handles voice calls through Twilio webhooks."

**[Show /api/ivr/incoming-call endpoint]**

"When someone calls the emergency number, this endpoint generates TwiML responses with voice prompts."

**[Demonstrate voice menu structure]**

"The system provides a simple 3-level menu: Welcome ‚Üí Report Dispute ‚Üí Record Details."

**[Show recording handlers]**

"Each step captures voice recordings for location, incident type, and description."

**[Show database integration]**

"Voice recordings are processed and stored as incident reports in the database."

**[Simulate call flow with curl/Postman]**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/ivr/incoming-call \
  -d "From=+231123456789&To=+231987654321"
```

"This simulates an incoming call and returns the TwiML response for voice prompts."

---

### System Integration Demonstration (45 seconds)

**[Screen: Split view showing multiple components]**

"All components work together seamlessly. When an incident is reported through any interface - voice, web, or mobile - it appears in the same database."

**[Show real-time data flow]**

"An incident created through the API immediately appears in the web dashboard and mobile app."

**[Demonstrate authentication across platforms]**

"The JWT authentication system works consistently across all interfaces."

**[Show error handling]**

"The system includes proper error handling and validation at every level."

---

### Technical Highlights (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Code overview]**

"Key technical achievements include:"

- "RESTful API design with proper HTTP status codes"
- "JWT-based authentication with role-based access control"
- "PostgreSQL database with normalized schema and relationships"
- "Responsive React frontend with TailwindCSS"
- "Progressive Web App with offline capabilities"
- "Twilio integration for voice-based emergency reporting"

---

### Closing (15 seconds)

**[Screen: System architecture diagram]**

"LILERP demonstrates a complete full-stack solution addressing real-world challenges in rural emergency response. The system bridges traditional governance structures with modern technology, providing accessible emergency services for underserved communities."
