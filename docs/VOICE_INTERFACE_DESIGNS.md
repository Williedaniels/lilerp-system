# LILERP Voice Interface Design Documentation

## Overview

This document presents the complete voice interface design for LILERP's Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system. The designs prioritize accessibility for illiterate users while maintaining cultural sensitivity and technical feasibility for rural deployment in Nimba County, Liberia.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

- **Accessibility First**: Designed for users with no literacy or technology experience
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respects traditional communication patterns and governance structures
- **Simplicity**: Maximum 3-level menu depth to prevent user confusion
- **Reliability**: Works on basic feature phones with poor connectivity

### Visual Design Language

- **Colors**: Green (safety, growth) and Blue (trust, reliability) with high contrast
- **Typography**: Clear, large text for visual representations
- **Icons**: Universal symbols (phone, recording, keypad) for intuitive understanding
- **Layout**: Clean, uncluttered interfaces with clear hierarchy

- Emergency contact numbers for escalation
- Pause/stop controls for user control

**Technical Implementation**:

- Records to Twilio's cloud storage
- Automatic transcription where available
- Maximum recording length limits
- Audio quality optimization for rural networks

### 5. IVR System Architecture

![IVR System Architecture](./assignment/assets/chapter3_system_architecture.png)

**Purpose**: Technical overview of system components and data flow

**Components Shown**:

- **Incoming Phone Call**: Entry point for all voice interactions
- **Node.js Backend API**: Processes TwiML responses and handles business logic
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Stores incident reports and user data
- **Notification System**: Alerts responders and traditional chiefs

**Data Flow**:

1. User calls emergency number
2. Twilio routes to Node.js webhook
3. System generates TwiML response for voice prompts
4. User inputs captured and processed
5. Incident record created in database
6. Notifications sent to appropriate responders

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Figma Design Creation

1. **Setup Design System**:
   - Create color palette: Primary Blue (#1e40af), Secondary Green (#059669), Emergency Red (#dc2626)
   - Set up text styles: Headers (24px), Body (18px), Captions (14px)
   - Create component library for buttons, keypads, and status indicators

2. **Voice Flow Diagram**:
   - Use flowchart shapes with rounded corners
   - Connect with clear arrows showing user paths
   - Add decision diamonds for user choices
   - Include error handling paths and fallbacks

3. **Phone Interface Mockups**:
   - Use standard smartphone frame (iPhone/Android)
   - Implement keypad with proper DTMF layout
   - Add audio waveform components for voice feedback
   - Include status bars and call controls

4. **Interactive Prototyping**:
   - Link screens to show complete user journey
   - Add micro-interactions for button presses
   - Include loading states and error messages
   - Test accessibility with screen reader simulation

### Cultural Considerations

- **Language**: Start with English, plan for Mano and Gio translations
- **Tone**: Respectful, calm voice prompts appropriate for emergency situations
- **Authority**: Integration with traditional chief notification systems
- **Privacy**: Minimal data collection respecting community values

### Technical Integration

- **Twilio Webhooks**: Each menu level corresponds to a webhook endpoint
- **Database Schema**: Incident records include voice recording URLs
- **Authentication**: Responder access through separate admin interface
- **Monitoring**: Call analytics and system performance tracking

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Users (Illiterate Rural Residents)
